# Bootstrap-aggregating-bagging-implementation

# Description:
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble method that builds multiple versions of a predictor (e.g., decision trees) on different bootstrapped datasets and averages their outputs to reduce variance and prevent overfitting. In this project, we implement BaggingClassifier using scikit-learn on the Iris dataset.

# ðŸ“¦ What This Project Shows:
* Applies bootstrapping to create multiple training subsets

* Trains base learners (Decision Trees) on these subsets

* Aggregates predictions (majority vote for classification)
